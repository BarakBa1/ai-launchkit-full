# n8n-installer Project Progress

## Current Task: Add Gotenberg Service to n8n-installer

### Implementation Progress
All major components have been implemented successfully:

1. ✅ Added Gotenberg service to `docker-compose.yml`
   - Created service configuration with proper Docker image, port exposure, healthcheck, and profiles
   - Set DISABLE_GOOGLE_CHROME=false to ensure PDF generation capabilities

2. ✅ Added Gotenberg to Caddy reverse proxy configuration
   - Added new block in Caddyfile that maps the GOTENBERG_HOSTNAME to the internal service
   - Ensured consistency with other service proxy configurations

3. ✅ Added Gotenberg to service selection wizard
   - Updated `scripts/04_wizard.sh` to include Gotenberg in the service selection menu
   - Added descriptive text for the service selection UI

4. ✅ Updated environment variable configuration
   - Added GOTENBERG_HOSTNAME to `.env.example`
   - Updated caddy container's environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`

5. ✅ Updated documentation
   - Added Gotenberg description and link to README.md
   - Added service URL to access list in Quick Start section
   - Documented use cases for n8n integration

### Testing Status
- ✅ Successfully validated Docker Compose configuration for Gotenberg service
- ⏳ Pending tests:
  - Full installation flow with Gotenberg selected
  - Service accessibility test via domain
  - API functionality test with n8n workflow
  - Compatibility tests with other services

### Next Steps
- Complete remaining tests
- Verify all components work together correctly
- Create a sample n8n workflow to demonstrate integration

### Reflection Highlights
- **What Went Well**: Consistent pattern implementation, comprehensive component coverage, thorough requirements analysis, documentation excellence
- **Challenges**: Docker image configuration complexity, service resource requirements understanding, API security considerations
- **Lessons Learned**: Pattern adherence accelerates development, component mapping is critical, documentation during implementation is valuable
- **Next Steps**: Complete testing phase, create sample n8n workflow, validate full installation flow
