# Active Context: Ready for Next Task

## Current Task Context
**Previous Task**: Gotenberg Service Integration - COMPLETED & ARCHIVED

The Gotenberg document conversion service integration has been successfully completed through all development phases:
- ✅ Planning and requirements analysis
- ✅ Implementation of all 6 component integrations  
- ✅ Comprehensive reflection and lessons learned documentation
- ✅ Complete archiving with full traceability

**Status**: Task fully archived and Memory Bank reset for next task

## Next Task Preparation
The Memory Bank is now ready to receive a new task. To begin:
- Use **VAN MODE** for task initialization and complexity assessment
- The archived Gotenberg integration serves as a reference for future service integrations

## Integration Approach
The integration follows the established pattern for optional services in the n8n-installer project:

1. **Docker Compose Integration**: 
   - Service defined in docker-compose.yml with profile "gotenberg"
   - Uses official image: gotenberg/gotenberg:8
   - Exposes internal port 3000
   - Includes healthcheck configuration
   - Configured with Chrome support for HTML-to-PDF conversion

2. **Reverse Proxy Configuration**:
   - Added to Caddyfile with environment variable substitution
   - Format: `{$GOTENBERG_HOSTNAME} { reverse_proxy gotenberg:3000 }`
   - Follows the same pattern as other services for consistency

3. **Service Selection Mechanism**:
   - Added to the interactive wizard in scripts/04_wizard.sh
   - Description: "Gotenberg (Document Conversion API)"
   - Selectable alongside other optional services

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Added GOTENBERG_HOSTNAME to .env.example
   - Added to caddy service environment variables
   - Uses domain template substitution (yourdomain.com)

5. **Documentation**:
   - Added to "What's Included" section in README.md
   - Added to services access list
   - Included use cases for n8n integration

## Key Implementation Considerations
- **Security**: Internal-only service, no external access, secured by Docker network isolation
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal resource requirements but may spike during PDF rendering
- **n8n Integration**: Accessible via HTTP requests in n8n workflows using internal Docker network
- **API Usage**: Standard REST API with endpoints for different conversion types
- **Network Access**: Available only within Docker network at http://gotenberg:3000

## API Usage with n8n
When integrated with n8n, Gotenberg provides document conversion capabilities accessible via these endpoints:

1. **HTML to PDF**: `http://gotenberg:3000/forms/chromium/convert/html`
2. **URL to PDF**: `http://gotenberg:3000/forms/chromium/convert/url`
3. **Markdown to PDF**: `http://gotenberg:3000/forms/chromium/convert/markdown`
4. **Office to PDF**: `http://gotenberg:3000/forms/libreoffice/convert`
5. **Image Format Conversion**: `http://gotenberg:3000/forms/chromium/convert/pdf`

These endpoints can be called from HTTP Request nodes in n8n workflows, providing document conversion capabilities for automation workflows.

## Testing Strategy
- Configuration validation via docker-compose config
- Service accessibility testing when deployed
- API endpoint testing with sample document conversions
- Integration testing with n8n workflows
